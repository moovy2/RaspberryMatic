# This script tries to identify whether this OpenCCU is reachable from the
# public internet in an insecure way. It performs three independent checks:
#
#  1) a local configuration audit which reliably detects the most critical
#     misconfiguration (the WebUI being reachable from the internet *without*
#     a password) without depending on any (unreliable) external self-scan,
#  2) a firewall protection state audit which verifies that the on-device
#     firewall is actually restricting access to local source networks when
#     it is supposed to (i.e. it catches a silently failed prevention), and
#  3) a best-effort external port scan of the public IPv4 address which tries
#     to identify a router port forwarding that links back to this CCU.
#
# Note on detection limits: a host can not reliably observe its own external
# attack surface from behind the NAT/firewall (a self-scan of the device's
# own public IPv6 address for example is always answered locally via the
# loopback path and would therefore yield false positives). The actual
# *prevention* of external access is therefore implemented in the on-device
# firewall (see /lib/libfirewall.tcl), which restricts the WebUI and other
# services to local source networks by default. This script complements that
# firewall and warns about the remaining, locally detectable risks.
#
# This script returns the following result codes:
#
# 0 = No insecure internet exposure identified (or check not possible)
# 1 = Insecure internet exposure identified
#
# Usage:
#   checkPortForwarding.sh [-q|--quiet]
# Default mode prints execution details to stdout.

# presence of this file means the user explicitly allowed external (internet)
# access to the WebUI and services (disabling the local-only firewall
# restriction), see /lib/libfirewall.tcl
