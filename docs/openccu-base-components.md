# OpenCCU-Base component selection

The `openccu-base` Buildroot package exposes individual options for its native
programs, Tcl modules, prebuilt Java/logic applications and runtime data. All
supported components default to enabled on 64-bit targets. The existing 32-bit
multilib configuration remains limited to the two compatibility libraries.

## Native components

Each name below is a suffix of `BR2_PACKAGE_OPENCCU_BASE_`:

| Option | Program |
| --- | --- |
| `SETINTERFACECLOCK` | `SetInterfaceClock` |
| `CRYPTTOOL` | `crypttool` |
| `EQ3CONFIGCMD` | `eq3configcmd` |
| `EQ3CONFIGD` | `eq3configd` |
| `SSDPD` | `ssdpd` |
| `MULTIMACD` | `multimacd` |
| `RFD` | `rfd` |
| `HS485D` | `hs485d` and its selected loader |
| `HS485DLOADER` | `hs485dLoader` |
| `HSS_LED` | `hss_led` and the `hss_ledctl` link |
| `TCLREGA` | `tclrega.so` |
| `TCLRPC` | `tclrpc.so` |

CMake derives the internal shared-library closure from the real link graph.
Only selected programs and their required libraries are installed, including
when a previous staging directory contains other outputs.
`HSS_LED_STATUS_MONITOR` independently controls the CCU status thread and its
XML-RPC dependencies. Disabling it retains the LED controller and CLI.
OpenCCU-Base declares `hss_ledctl` as a runtime alias of `hss_led`;
CMake stages and installs the relative symlink, including in recovery builds.

## Applications and runtime data

`REGAHSS` selects the prebuilt logic engine and its Tcl extension. `WEBUI` depends
on it and selects the Tcl helpers, XML-RPC module and device descriptions.
`HMSERVER` and `HMIP_TOOLS` select the prebuilt Java services and coprocessor
maintenance tools respectively, and require the Java runtime.

`DEVICETYPES`, `FIRMWARE`, `TCL_HOMEMATIC` and `HM_SCRIPTS` select device
descriptions, firmware payloads, Tcl helpers and maintenance scripts.
`CONFIG_TEMPLATES` installs templates belonging to selected services.

The remaining legacy rootfs patches span several asset components. When any
patched asset is needed, the build prepares the complete asset input in a
separate directory and applies the patch series there. Only selected directories
are copied into the image. A native-only selection, such as recovery, needs no
WebUI/Tcl asset generation or rootfs patching.

## Services and system integration

`INIT_SCRIPTS` controls service startup files. User/group definitions follow the
selected services. `ssdpd` runs as `ssdp` in both images. `eq3configd` normally
runs as `eq3cfg` in both; group ID 995 is shared by the separately built images
so it can read `root:eq3cfg` encryption keys. When an existing key is still
unreadable by the recovery account, recovery temporarily starts `eq3configd`
as root without changing the key. The main system assigns the fixed group to
the key during its next normal boot. The LED controller retains its own user
and status group whenever selected.

`SYSTEM_INTEGRATION` enables main-system filesystem setup, license-page creation
and persistent configuration initialization at service startup. Recovery disables
this option while keeping `INIT_SCRIPTS` enabled. The package writes the
configuration policy into `S50eq3configd` when installing it.

Recovery calls the common board post-build script after applying its overlay.
It links `/run` to `/var/run`, retaining the recovery version and init services
without enabling main-system integration.

After board overlays are applied, the post-build script removes startup files
and Monit entries for deselected services. Optional LED and radio maintenance
calls are guarded when their tools are absent. Shared interface-list generation
lives in `S49InitInterfaces`, independently of the Wired loader, and omits
interfaces whose radio service is not installed.

Recovery explicitly selects `CRYPTTOOL`, `EQ3CONFIGCMD`, `EQ3CONFIGD`, `SSDPD`,
`HSS_LED` and `INIT_SCRIPTS`. It does not use a special CMake or package build mode.

Use a clean Buildroot output directory after changing selections. Neither
Buildroot nor CMake installation uninstalls an older image's files. Full hardware
validation is still needed for custom combinations of radio services.
