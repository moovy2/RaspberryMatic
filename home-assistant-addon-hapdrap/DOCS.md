# Home Assistant App: OpenCCU (HAP/DRAP Helper)

## About

This app is a helper component for OpenCCU in Home Assistant environments where
HmIP-HAP or HmIPW-DRAP devices are used.

It does **not** provide a full OpenCCU system by itself. Instead, it manages the
Docker network setup required so the regular OpenCCU app can communicate
reliably with HmIP-HAP/HmIPW-DRAP devices via multicast UDP.

## Important notes

- This app requires elevated permissions because it manages Docker networking.
- Run this helper together with the regular OpenCCU app.

## Installation and setup

1. Install and start the regular OpenCCU app.
2. Install this OpenCCU HAP/DRAP Helper app.
3. In this app configuration, set **OpenCCU IP** to a free and dedicated LAN IPv4 address.
4. Disable **Protection mode** for this helper app.
5. Enable **Start on boot** so it starts with Home Assistant.

| `openccu_ip` | Yes | Static free LAN IPv4 address used for the OpenCCU app macvlan interface. |

| `openccu_slug` | No | Slug of the OpenCCU app if different from default naming (default: `openccu`). |
| `network_name` | No | Name of the macvlan Docker network used for OpenCCU connectivity (default: `ccu`). |
