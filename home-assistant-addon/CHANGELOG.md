# What's Changed

> [!WARNING]
> **`HmIP-RFUSB-TK` issues**
>
> If you are using a `HmIP-RFUSB-TK` (with `-TK` in the product name) to communicate with your HomematicIP devices, please make sure to update to Home Assistant OS [17.1rc1](https://github.com/home-assistant/operating-system/releases/tag/17.1.rc1) or newer first, because only with 17.1 or newer full compatibility with `HmIP-RFUSB-TK` is restored!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **🧪 Home Assistant OS 17.x required**
>
> This OpenCCU HA-Addon version requires at least [Home Assistant OS 17.x](https://github.com/home-assistant/operating-system/releases) or newer to be installed to work properly! So if you update
> to this OpenCCU version please ensure that you have your Home Assistant OS version updated accordingly.
